        \n\n
        Touch is transforming how we interact with computers, and motion control can do the same
        \n\n
        Gesture interaction with computers had long been the stuff of sci-fi, until the recent socially-awkward flamboyant games such as Xbox Kinect began to enter the mainstream.
        \n\n
        <b><i>The first question everybody asks is, ‘So what can it do?</i></b>

        The first question everybody asks is, <b>‘So what can it do?’</b>. The short answer is, today, very little.
        \n\n
        Tomorrow? Well, I for one am a believer. What we have here is a limitation of imagination, not of technology.
        \n\n
        <b>That is usually a catalyst for innovation.</b>
